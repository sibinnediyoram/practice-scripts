2. Imagine a server with the following specs:

● 4 times Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E7-4830 v4 @ 2.00GHz
● 64GB of ram
● 2 TB HDD disk space
● 2 x 10Gbit/s nics

The server is used for SSL offloading and proxies around 25000 requests per second. Please
let us know which metrics are interesting to monitor in that specific case and how would you
do that? What are the challenges of monitoring this?

Solution:
We need to consider below metrics for monitoring of ssl offloading server:
1. Https traffic handling by the server
2. Open Connections - The number of connections open at the given sample moment
3. SSL certificate validity
4. CPU and memory resource utilization
5. Latency 
6. Inbound Traffic - The number of bytes sent from external endpoints to configured backends
7. Outbound Traffic - The number of bytes sent from configured backends to external endpoints
8. New Connections per second - The number of connections that were created . 
9. Transactions Per Second:  Primarily gated by the available CPU
10. Concurrent connections:  Memory is the limiting factor
11. Bulk throughput:  Dependent upon CPU and the maximum packets per second 
12. Packet loss, round trip average

Proxy metrics:
1. Frontend metrics such as client connections and requests
2. Backend metrics such as availability and health of backend servers
3. Health metrics that reflect the state of your Proxy setup


Challenges:
1. Figuring out proper threshold value for alerts
2. Montoring agents should light weight does not affect the actual performance of the server due to resource consumption
3. Usage of apt metrics which serves the prupose
